Game Designed by Team Kaiju using 3d model and animations of Kaiju Dino (`not all animations found in-game but are in blender files`)


Animations and general movement are better on a controller

**pause/pause menu**: esc key

on controller:
* tilt world left = left bumper
* tilt world right = right bumper
* Tail whip attack = Right Trigger
* left analog joystick = Motion controls

On keyboard:
* tilt world left = q
* tilt world right = e
* Tail whip attack = click mouse button
* move forward = w
* move backward = s
* turn left = a
* turn right = d

```
